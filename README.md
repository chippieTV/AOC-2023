# AOC 2023

I decided that although I want to learn some new languages that my first time
to do AOC and my first run I would keep it simple and go with a language I know
well enough to not make that the difficulty.

First pass at this is just hacky JS, no attempt (reduced attempt) at optimization,
brute force ok.

After I would like to revisit in some other languages once I have the logic down,
just as a secondary learning exercise.
